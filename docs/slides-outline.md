# Slides Outline (10–12 mins talk + 45–75 mins hands-on)

1) **Why threat model at a hackathon?**
   - You’re shipping fast

3) **DFD + Trust Boundaries**
   - External entities, processes, data stores, data flows
   - Trust boundaries show where assumptions change

4) **How we’ll work today**
   - Diagram → Threats → Mitigations → Validate

5) **What judges can understand**
   - Show your DFD
   - Show your top 5 threats + mitigations
   - Explain tradeoffs (“hackathon fix now vs later”)
